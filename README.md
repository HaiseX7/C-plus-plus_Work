# Polynomial Reader
This is a program that will prompt the user for two polynomials and then display information
about each one. A valid polynomial will have 1) At least one term, 2) Terms entered in
descending order by exponent value, and 3) No terms with zero coefficient (except for the
polynomial with value zero). Next, the program will list the terms needed to multiply the
two polynomials. The user is then allowed to evaluate the first polynomial entered with any
value for variable x. Finally, the user is able to scale the first polynomial with a scale factor.
